<h3>User-Friendly Statistical Software</h3>
</header>
<p>User-friendly statistical software is the most efficient and straightforward
tool for disseminating statistical findings to a larger group of users, both
statisticians and non-statisticians. We have a team of computer scientists and
statisticians to develop web application and stand-alone software for
implementing the state-of-art statistical methodologies.</p>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence Diagnostics Devices</h3>
</header>
<p>We develop deep-learning neural network tools for the diagnosis and
prediction of diseases. We have multiple ongoing projects that aim at using
various artificial intelligence tools to early diagnose cancer or triage medical
conditions to help emergent health-care decision-makings.</p>
