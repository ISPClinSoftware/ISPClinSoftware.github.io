<h3>Real-World Data and Evidence</h3>
</header>
<p> The amount of real-world data collected from sources other than
  protocol-driven clinical studies is increasing ultra-rapidly. The clinical
  evidence that can be derived from analysis of these real-world data can
  complement the knowledge derived from traditional well-controlled clinical
  trials. We have developed novel methods that have been accepted by the FDA for
  leveraging real world evidence in clinical trial design and anlysis. </p>
